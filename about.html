With the underlying belief that the spaces we spend our time in affect our outlook on the world, Rebecca launched Captivate Interiors to design spaces that leave her clients renewed, energized, and inspired. Rebecca looks to her clients for inspiration as each person, each family, each business has a unique story to tell. It is our job to hear that story and expand the melody.

                                <br />
                                Working remotely (before that became a thing) Ali was an integral member of the RJI team during her college years. She began her professional career in the commercial design world working for LPA in San Diego, and Oz Architecture in Denver, focusing on education and public space design. Missing the direct collaboration between design and construction, Ali made the move back to R Johnston Interiors. Heading up our growing Denver design studio, Ali’s knowledge of commercial and residential construction and design, along with her passion for collaboration and deep-thinking, bring value to every project she leads.

                            <p class="fw-bold">After extensive training in construction and design and having worked in the field for over a decade, I founded Captivate Interiors in 2019. <br />
                                My design philosophy is simple — I believe a home is your sanctuary and should be comfortable and cozy but also carefully curated. My approach to design always begins with an ode to the architecture of the space, the personality and needs of my client infused with my personal aesthetics. I like to work with clean modern lines, layered with texture and color with a mix of midcentury classics and vintage pieces. I always try to bring in natural elements to achieve some earthiness and calm that I believe every home should have.
                                <br />
                                My work is influenced by my Indian roots and the various cities that I have worked in and traveled to across the globe. I am deeply motivated to support artisans in my projects, finding value and beauty in unique & hand-made things.
